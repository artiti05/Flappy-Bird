# Flappy Bird Game

A simple Flappy Bird game clone built using Python and the Pygame library.

## Overview
In this game, the player controls a bird that automatically moves forward and falls due to gravity. The objective is to guide the bird through gaps in vertically aligned pipes without colliding. Points are scored by successfully passing through the pipes, and the game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

## Features
- Realistic physics for bird movement (gravity and flapping mechanics).
- Randomly generated pipes with varying gaps.
- Scoring system based on the number of pipes successfully passed.
- Sound effects for flapping and collision events.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Play
- Press the **Spacebar** to make the bird flap its wings.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground.
- Try to score as high as possible by passing through the pipes.
